# PollyPoll

# Problem Statement
<h4>
 To Build a online application will be distinct from other well-known social media platforms since it will focus largely on producing and participating in live polls. Users will be able to vote on polls according to their interest tags since polls will also be categorised using tags.</h4>
 
 # OUR IDEA
 
 <h4>Our visionary idea is to create a platform that will be used primarily for voting/polling. People who are creators can make arbitrary polls and can add pertinent tags to their posts. The ability to vote for pertinent polls using tags of interest allows viewers to participate in any live poll they want. You may learn what people's opinions are on a certain poll that the creator has established.</h4>
 
 # TECH STACK
 
 <h4>PollyPoll will be composed of combination of coding frameworks and languages including Python, HTML, Django, mySQL.</h4>
